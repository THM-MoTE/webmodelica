- UserSvc the user service contains user informations. Its needed by AuthSvc and we use it to store user informations.

=== Database users / identity login

* login using local database users is enabled through the identity provider in auth-svc.settings.yml:
[source, yml]
----
    identity:
      name: 'Database login'
      color: '#00796b'
      icon: 'database'
      uid_field: 'username'
      enabled: true
      fields:
