CAUTION: if not otherwise specified, we are using Twitter Futures, not Scala Futures!

== Redis Usage

We are using redis as cache, as well as session store:

* the user model is _cached_ because we need it for validating authentication tokens.
* autocomplete suggestions are _cached_.
* mapping session _UUIDs to its session model_ is done using redis:
  the redis key is the session UUID and its value is the session model.
  This removes any state from the Webmodelica backend and moves it into redis.
  Without state, we can easily scale the backend servers.

== Sessions

A session is a connection between a project, a running MoPE project instance and the project directory containing the modelica files.
MoPE assigns each open project an ID so does Webmodelica.
Webmodelica assigns a UUID, whereas MoPE assigns integers.
The project directory is currently resolved as `<owner>_<project name>`.

The session model is saved into redis to avoid state in Webmodelica.
