== Architecture

CAUTION: if not otherwise specified, we are using Twitter Futures, not Scala Futures!

=== Redis Usage

We are using redis as cache, as well as session store:

* the user model is _cached_ because we need it for validating authentication tokens.
* autocomplete suggestions are _cached_.
* mapping session _UUIDs to its session model_ is done using redis:
  the redis key is the session UUID and its value is the session model.
  This removes any state from the Webmodelica backend and moves it into redis.
  Without state, we can easily scale the backend servers.

=== Sessions

A session is a connection between a project, a running MoPE project instance and the project directory containing the modelica files.
MoPE assigns each open project an ID so does Webmodelica.
Webmodelica assigns a UUID, whereas MoPE assigns integers.
The project directory is currently resolved as `<owner>_<project name>`.

The session model is saved into redis to avoid state in Webmodelica.

=== File paths & shared volume
The Webmodelica backend and MoPE container share a volume to access the project files.
Because its a shared volume, that is mounted somewhere in the container, a path in the Webmodelica backend isn't necessarily the same as in MoPE.
If the volume is mounted into Webmodelica at `/data` and in MoPE at `/home/openmodelica/data` the paths aren't the same:

.A simple Path Example
====
- path as seen from Webmodelica: `[red]#/data#/tom_testProject/utils/fac.mo`
- path as seen from MoPE: `[blue]#/home/openmodelica/data#/tom_testProject/utils/fac.mo`
====

However, for compiling modelica files, we need the absolute path to the currently open file.
This path must be *valid for* MoPE and not for Webmodelica:

.A compilation request for MoPE.
[source, sh]
----
http POST mope:9001/mope/project/0/compile

{ "path": "/home/openmodelica/data/tom_testProject/utils/fac.mo" } <1>
----

.The response from MoPE.
[source, json]
----
[{
  "end": {
      "column": 2,
      "line": 4
  },
  "file": "/home/openmodelica/data/tom_testProject/utils/fac.mo", <1>
  "message": "Missing token: SEMICOLON",
  "start": {
      "column": 2,
      "line": 4
  },
  "type": "Error"
}]

----

<1> This path is known in MoPE, but not in Webmodelica. In Webmodelica it would be: `/data/tom_testProject/utils/fac.mo`.

The compilation response contains paths to modelica files, that are valid in the MoPE context but *not in* Webmodelica.
Furthermore users don't care about the absolute path.
Users are only interested in the path starting at the project directory.
All of this means that we need a mapping mechanism, that converts paths *between this two root directories*.

The _webmodelica.services.MopeService.PathMapper_ trait in `webmodelica/services/MopeService.scala` describes such a mapper.

IMPORTANT: The PathMapper needs both paths: the webmodelicas path and MoPE path.
  These paths are configured in `webmodelica.conf` at `mope.data.host-directory` and `mope.data.bind-directory`.
  Here the `host-directory` is the Webmodelica path and `bind-directory` is the MoPE path.
