=== Docker
The backend, frontend and MoPE server are published as docker containers to https://hub.docker.com/u/thmmote[DockerHub]:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/thmmote/webmodelica[backend]
- https://hub.docker.com/r/thmmote/webmodelica-ui[frontend]
- https://hub.docker.com/r/thmmote/mope-server[mope]

Starting a production deployment should be as simple as:

- Setup authentication providers by copying the `auth-svc.settings.sample.yml` file:

[source,sh]
----
$ cp deployment/config/auth-svc.settings.sample.yml deployment/config/auth-svc.settings.yml
----
 
setup your providers as needed, the *developer login* is enabled by default.

- Running
+
[source, sh]
----
$ docker-compose --project-name wm -f deployment/docker-compose.yml -f deployment/docker-compose.prod.yml up
----

Now you can access the frontend at `localhost:80`.

- Viewing the development database: You can access the database via mongoshell by logging into the corresponding mongo container:

[source,sh]
----
$ docker container exec -it <container name> mongo <database name>
$ docker container exec -it deployment_mongo_1 mongo wm-dev
----


=== Developer Documentation

The developer documentation is available in _doc/_.
You can generate a html file:

[source, sh]
----
$ make deps #install dependencies
$ make #generate html file
----

NOTE: you need _bundler_ to install the dependencies.
